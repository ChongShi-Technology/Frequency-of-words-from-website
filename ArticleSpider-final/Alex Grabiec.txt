Back East
These photographs are an edit from a larger project titled back east. The body of work is a group of peripatetic images that offer oblique hints to the perception of place, presentness, distance, and demarcation.
Photographed along a weekly four hour commute between his professional life in Baltimore and family life rural Virginia, the images document interweaving subtexts of home, construction, loose signals, and superfluous boundaries. Within this personal narrative the body of work investigates the line between the natural and the human-made in order to reflect on the complex relationship between the idealized and the real.
