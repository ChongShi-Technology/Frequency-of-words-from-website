Hey Baby! We’re excited to release the results of our latest ‘What We’ve Found’ Call for Entry.
What we’ve found is that the naked human body is the most common idea of love, sex, heartbreak, whatever. The intimacy achieved in the submissions feels fabricated as the camera acts like another set of eyes in the room. Intimacy becomes a performance. Perhaps because we’re viewing the photo it feels like we’ve disturbed the moment. What We’ve Found is  capturing true intimacy is nearly impossible, but it sure is fun to look at.
What we’ve found is that the ‘lack’ of intimacy (you know, that primal, glamorized, documented sex) portrayed in many of the submissions was appropriated pornography distorted in some fashion. The other common image was a late-night kiss shared by strangers. What we’ve found is that when it comes to love, even the most beautiful medium can’t represent the feelings as strongly as they come.
What we’ve found is that heartbreak is represented by absence. A photograph of dead flowers working as a visual poem. What we’ve found is that most of you are 
hopeless
 romantics (don’t worry, so are we).
We’re truly grateful for your submissions. We love you. Keep an eye out for the next ‘What We’ve Found’ theme!
